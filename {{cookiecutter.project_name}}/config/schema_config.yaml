# Schema Configuration for {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

# Example schema configuration
# Customize this based on your data source and requirements

# Node types
# Example protein node
protein:  # Class name in lowercase, exists in the ontology
  represented_as: node
  input_label: protein  # Used to identify the node in the input (second element of the node tuple)
  properties:  # Keys of the property dictionary (third element of the node tuple)
    - name
    - description
    - organism
    - sequence

# Example gene node
gene:  # Class name in lowercase, exists in the ontology
  represented_as: node
  input_label: gene
  properties:
    - name
    - symbol
    - description
    - chromosome
    - start_position
    - end_position

# Edge types
# Example protein-gene relationship
protein_encoded_by_gene:  # Edge name in lowercase, does not exist in the ontology
  is_a: association  # Attached to type that exists in the ontology
  represented_as: edge
  input_label: encoded_by  # Used to identify the edge in the input (fourth element of the edge tuple)
  source: protein  # Source node type
  target: gene  # Target node type
  properties:  # Keys of the property dictionary (fifth element of the edge tuple)
    - confidence
    - evidence

# TODO: Add more node and edge types based on your data source
